                            <h5>1.Low Investment and High Return on Investment : </h5>
                            <p>Android has a low barrier to entry. Android provides its SDK (Software Development Kit) to the
                              developer community which minimizes the development and licensing costs. The development cost can be
                              divided into three stages :
                              <br><br>
                              Stage1: Application Development
                              <br>
                              Stage2: Testing
                              <br>
                              Stage3: Hardware cost for testing and deploying the android mobile application
                            </p>
          
                            <h5>2.Easy to Integrate :</h5>
                            <p>An Android App can be the best solution for complex technical customization and integration of a
                              web application or just a Smartphone application you already have. Android is the best mobile
                              platform between the application and processes helping you to integrate the apps.</p>
          
                            <h5>3.Customizable User Interface : </h5>
                            <p>Apps developed using Android platform are highly customizable and very easy to manage. This is a
                              great boost for android app development companies to flourish their business by making custom
                              android apps for business. Even the data management and multimedia tools can be updated easily. </p>

                              This solution is a mixture, hence the name hybrid, of both native and web solutions. The core of the
                              application is written using the most famous web technologies that are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                              (JS), which are then encapsulated within a native application. Through the use of plugins, these
                              applications can easily access all features of mobile devices the heart of a hybrid-mobile
                              application is still just an application that is written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However,
                              instead of the app being shown within the user’s browser, it is run from within a native application
                              and its own embedded browser, which is essentially invisible to the user. Therefore, there is an
                              increasing demand for Hybrid app development in the world. In this growing market, to find someone
                              with expertise on Hybrid app solution has become very difficult for start-ups and projects.

                            <h2>The Benefits of Hybrid Application Development </h2>
                            <br>
          
                            <h5>1. Enhanced UI/UX : </h5>
                            <p>Hybrid App Development offers a consistent and flawless user experience across IOS, Android
                              platforms. Hybrid applications are about making it work for mobile by embracing the web. Further,
                              the lightweight hybrid app UI helps in loading content and graphics quickly. The apps adapt faster
                              to different device screens for faster data display and seamless data streaming. The excellent UI
                              experience even improves the chances of the application’s approval at the app store.
                            </p>
                            <h5>2. Lesser Costs :</h5>
                            <p>The most significant advantages of hybrid apps are that they come up with reduced development
                              costs. The hybrid mobile development approach enables targeting multiple platforms without
                              maintaining numerous code bases. Unlike native apps, hybrid applications use a single code base for
                              various platforms. Thus, it allows the development teams to increase the speed of development
                              process, which reduces the time for product to come in the market. Also, it will enable them to
                              reach a larger number of users.</p>
          
                            <h5>3. Improved Performance of Apps : </h5>
                            <p>Hybrid apps offer high speed and performance just like native apps. In fact, in some cases, they
                              are even faster than various progressive and responsive apps. The reason is that there is no
                              dependency on network communication. Further, even apps with a higher number of users exhibit better
                              speed on almost all devices. Hybrid apps have already proven their high speed and performance
                              standards with brands like Twitter and LinkedIn. </p>
          
                            <h5>4. Reusing the code of the web app part : </h5>
                            <p> The code is written once and deployed across all mobile platforms. </p>
          
                            <h5>5. Reducing Development Time and Costs : </h5>
                            <p>The code is written once, which substantially reduces development time and costs as compared to
                              native apps which require development for iOS as well as development for Android.</p>

                              iPhone are very popular these days even though there are other types of smartphones launched by

                              your business. As around the world, there are millions of iPhone users who use their smartphone
                              to meet their daily requirements. If you are looking for iPhone app development in your project,
                              then our company<strong> Power2Create </strong>assures you to provide best quality apps.
                              <br><br>
                              Having iPhone app for your business makes a lot of sense because of many reasons. A large ratio of
                              your customers must be having iPhones so your business app would be compatible with the customer’s
                              device and therefore the customers would prefer to use your business app. The right business app
                              will be an additional service to your customers .There is actually a multitude of apps that was
                              designed for the iPhone out there but even you will enjoy having your own unique app to showcase
                              your company’s products and services.

                            <h2>The Benefits of IOS Application Development </h2>
                            <br>
                            <h5>1.Security of Enterprise Data :</h5>
                            <p>Intrusion into a business’s sensitive enterprise data lodged in apps is a big risk with Android
                              apps. But, when you compare the android with iPhone based on security, iPhone apps, protect firmware
                              and software through stringent security measures like:
                              <ul>
                                <li>Integrated data handling systems </li>
          
                                <li>Measures to prevent duplication of data</li>
          
                                <li>Measures to avoid loss of security due to data encryption </li>
                              </ul>
                              iPhone users are cushioned against hacking and malware. This again is a reason why iOS application
                              is preferred over android application.
                            </p>
          
                            <h5>2. Better App Revenue :</h5>
                            <p>iPhone apps have a greater ROI than Android apps. This is the fact that adds on to the benefits of
                              iOS App development, to a large extent.</p>
          
                            <h5>3. Tech-Ready Audience :</h5>
                            <p>iPhone users are found to be IT-literate and open-minded towards innovation. This presents
                              businesses with numerous opportunities to design challenging applications that can create disruption
                              in markets. Businesses that opt for iPhone app development can become market leaders and can take a
                              long step ahead of their competitors.</p>
          
                            <h5>4. Low Fragmentation & Easy Testing :</h5>
                            <p>Apple typically develops just one update on its existing OS every year. Also, the number of Apple
                              devices are lesser in number than Android-based ones. Hence, Android apps must be tested
                              comprehensively to check its working on all the versions of Android OS. iPhone apps just must meet
                              testing criteria of the prevalent iOS versions. This reduces testing time considerably and
                              guarantees a quick time to market for iOS apps. </p>

                              different people. While the obvious purpose of it is to increase sales, a company might want to
                              build its brand name using it or maybe conducting a research through it. It is a very effective way
                              of identifying the target market and discovering a market’s needs and wants.

                              part of internet marketing which certainly helps your business to grow unprecedently as you get to
